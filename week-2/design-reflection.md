**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**
The six stages of web design are: 

1) Information Gathering - in which you think about the reason for your site, your goals, target audience, and content.
2) Planning - the stage at which you make a high-level plan for your site and potentially create a site-map for that plan.
3) Design - where you work creating on the look and feel for your site
4) Development - when the site is actually built and the code is written
5) Testing and Delivery - the point at which you begin to test out the code you've written and check to make sure features are working. Once things are going smoothly, you can launch the site.
6) Maintenance - after launch you may want to or need to update your content and design, and fix any bugs. This process never really ends so long as you are keeping the site alive. 


**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**
My site's primary goal will be an expression of my web development skills. This will cover and blog posts reflecting upon that work.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
The target audience will be anyone interested in looking at my progress as a web developer. This will, naturally, cover many of my fellow students at DBC and instructors but also potentially any future prospective employers.


**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
Upon landing they should get a clear overview of my portfolio and be able to easily navigate to whatever they are looking for whether it is my blog or view my resume. Naturally, different users may want different things out of my site and it is perfectly acceptable for them to want to pursue different actions when they land at my home page.


**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
People should realize that design is central to running a successful site. Within that design, the focus on user experience is what keeps a site from looking great on paper to actually being useful for users. Many an idea sounds fantastic without actually having other people actually looking at it. Creating a site with users in mind prevents, or at least limits, this kind of problem.  


**What is user experience design and why is it valuable? **
User experience design is the process by which web site designers cater their site towards improving the experience of the users of the site. This is valuable because creating a user-friendly site can be the difference between users getting to what they want on your site and getting frustrated and leaving. Of course, if you are running a business this difference can be result in huge changes in revenue.

This is in contrast to old work models by which designers worked on implementing whatever they saw fit and appealing purely to whatever the client requested.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
The user experience blog post was needlessly long and somewhat repetitive.Additionally, answering the previous two questions on user experience design felt tedious as I felt they were somewhat overlapping.
