<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was interesting trying to duplicate the layout of someone's site using purely HTML. I'd never done anything quite like that before. Using my previous knowledge of HTML the specifics of the implementation weren't too challenging but it always feels great when you complete a project in web development.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Googling for semantic HTML5 elements presents many helpful resources and  using them feels great. As someone who learned a bit of HTML before HTML5 it initially took me a while to the new preferences but it's quite clear semantic elements are obviously superior to the alternatives as they are easy to read. 


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Given I'm a bit used to manipulating the HTML of blog posts to accomplish formatting, it's a bit of an adjustment to never do so. That said, I think it's helpful and I wouldn't say I was constantly tempted to do so.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?
You can accomplish pretty much anything with the basic syntax in HTML which is a huge plus. It's also very easy to figure out what any particular tag you are unfamiliar with does. The downsides of HTML are less clear to me now. I'm unsure if there will be clear in the future or I just find working in HTML to be simple. That said, I know some of the typical downsides of working in HTML are being reduced by using Sublime Text which automatically closes some of your tags and brackets.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
The opening and closing brackets are kind of burned into my mind so that's not muhc of a problem. The issue that comes up is implementing an HTML from a purely blank document means I have to remember to put the doctype, header and body frame into place. It's pretty easy to remember to do so, but I've struggled a bit with getting remembering to add the doctype tag simply because I've not had to do so much in the past either (because of copying from a previous document I'd worked on or only doing editing or already created documents).
