# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# --- error -------------------------------------------------------

# "Screw you guys " + "I'm going home." = cartmans_phrase

# 1. What is the name of the file with the error?
#    errors.rb
# 2. What is the line number where the error occurs?
#    8
# 3. What is the type of error message?
#    syntax error
# 4. What additional information does the interpreter provide about this type of error?
#    unexpected '=', expecting end of input
# 5. Where is the error in the code?
#    After the equals sign
# 6. Why did the interpreter give you this error?
#    In Ruby variables have to be the first element identified.
#    In other words, you would have needed to write that code as
#    follows: cartmans_phrase = "Screw you guys" + "I'm going home."

# This error was analyzed in the README file.

def cartman_hates(thing)
  while true
    puts "What's there to hate about #{thing}?"
end

# This is a tricky error. The line number may throw you off.

# 1. What is the name of the file with the error?
#    errors.rb
# 2. What is the line number where the error occurs?
#    172
# 3. What is the type of error message?
#    syntax error
# 4. What additional information does the interpreter provide about this type of error?
#    unexpected end of input, expecting keyword_end
# 5. Where is the error in the code?
#    The error is triggered after the last bit of code in the file.
#    However, the mistake in the code is that that while loop is not
#    closed with "end" so that the cartman_hates method is not closed.
# 6. Why did the interpreter give you this error?
#    Because there is one less "end" than necessary to close out the
#    method, the program looks indefinitely for it. Because there
#    aren't any in the rest of the program, it causes an error.
