## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

First, be confident normal person, you can do this. Next, bring up GitHub. If you are logged in, click on the big plus dropdown menu in the top right corner and select "New repository" (if you are not yet logged in, do so first... I'll wait.) Now type in a repository name in the top under the box usefully labeled "Repository name". Any spaces or special characters you add other than "-" and "_" will be converted to "-" so just to be clear, stick with just letters and "-" or "_".

Now, you can add a description if you'd like. Just select inside the box under "Description" and start typing. Put in something useful, something funny or nothing at all, it's up to you.

Select whether you'd like your repository to be public or private. Then, tick the box next to "Intialize this repository with a README" if you'd like to create a README file. (Follow the listed advice below this box on whether you should do so. If you don't understand the advice, I strongly encourage you to check the box). Now, click the "Create repository" button. You have now created a repository and have been brought to the web page of this new repository.

To clone it to your computer, copy the address from the box on the right side of the page labeled "HTTPS clone URL" by clicking on the little notepad with the arrow. Now, open your terminal and and navigate to where you'd like to copy your repository. Type "git clone " and then right click and paste in the address you just copied. Hit enter.

Congratualtions, non-technical person, you've done it. You've created a new repository and cloned it to your local machine. Pat yourself on the back (metaphorically or literally).

- Describe what open source means.

"Open source" means that a piece of software is able to be legally shared and customized by any and everyone however they like.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source software is highly useful but, like everything, it has it's drawbacks. Creating things for free is great because it means people without many resources can use the tools. While having volunteers create useful updates as they see fit or spin off products to their liking, this also means that some tools may languish as a product relies on its community motivated largely by good will for continued development.

Further, while some people may see open source software as the dawn of a new utopia, the fact that such great products are free can encourage an attitude that all software should be free which is unworkable on its face. Though you should never judge ideas based on how a disparate few will take them, this is nevertheless a real concern about the open source community.


- Assess the importance of using licenses.

Clarifying exactly how a product can be legally used and distrubted is extremely important. That open source software does this and almost always in clear language that anyone can understand makes their licenses more valuable than the average liscense.


- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Reeating the pull requests and creating new branches was useful as I feel I'm starting to get use to doing so. I didn't struggle with any of the work in this challenge because I was familiar with essentially all of it. However, it always feels good to launch something even if it's a tiny site with only a few words.


- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No, I did not.
