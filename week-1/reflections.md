##1.1 Think About Time Reflection

This challenge covered various time management techniques including timeboxing, the Fogg method and a few tips for encouraging work flow. Timeboxing is a scheduling technique in which you work for set periods of time with breaks before reflection instead of working continuously at a task until completion. A great example of timeboxing is the pomodoro technique, which I've employed in the past (albeit with longer intervals of 45 minutes working, 15 minutes of break than the suggested timeframe). 

I recently started using the time tracker Time Doctor to track my time and I'm pretty satisfied with it. It allows me to keep meticulous detail of my activities in an organized way and easily allows us me to demarcate breaks. In general, for Phase 0 I intend to use Time Doctor and the pomodoro technique together to work through tasks.

##1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell is a command language interpreter and bash is a command language.

2. The most challenging part of going through this material is simply the breadth of commands. If you aren't already familiar with using the command line, putting them together in useful combinations can be difficult.

3. Yes but, in fairness, I'd already gone through the Command Line Crash Course a few months ago and I had a much more difficult time doing so then.

4. For pure frequency, cd is likely the most used command but it's uses are very simple. However, being able to use popd and pushd effectively can save you a lot of time if your work requires much switching between directories but is slightly more difficult to adjust to. It's also very useful to be able to pull up a file from the command line so using becoming comfortable navigating and appending files from the shell is a must.

5. Yes, in order they are:

pwd - print working directory

ls - list directory

mv - move a file or directory (rename)

cd - change directory

../ - up one directory

touch - create an empty file

mkdir - make directory

less - page through a directory

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove a file

help - read a manual page
