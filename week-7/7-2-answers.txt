Introduction
Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
None of the concepts were really new to me. That said, reading over
the way to implement adding 1 to 10 using only bits was interesting.
The difficulty of working with programs like that and manipulating
data in a modern programming language could hardly be more dramatic.

Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators
Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.

Ch. 2: Program Structure
What is an expression?

What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?

What causes a variable to return undefined?

Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.

What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?

Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.

Describe while and for loops

What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?

Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.

Ch. 3: Functions

What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?

When should you use functions?

What is a function declaration?

Complete the minimum exercise in the eloquent.js file.

Ch. 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]

Create an object called me that stores your name, age, three favorite foods, and a quirk in your eloquent.js file.

What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?
